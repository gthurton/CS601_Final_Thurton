        <p>
          From an early age, I always knew I had a love for math and solving
          problems. So, when my dad suggested that I become an engineer just
          like him, I was ready for the challenge. I decided to join a club in
          highschool called Girls Who Code, where I learned some basic Java. I
          instantly knew that it was a career that I was extremely passionate
          about.
        </p>
        <p>
          Throughout college,
          I continued to strengthen my Java as well as gain exposure to other
          coding languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, R and C++. Now, I have graduated from the University of Pittsburgh.  I am
          currently working as an Engineering Associate at Wells Fargo while
          simultaneously pursuing my Master's Degree at Boston University. At
          work, I am learning .NET. I am super excited to continue learning
          programming languages and strengthen my skills!
